# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack on RSA (timing side-channel)
# Summary: Potential RSA private key recovery through timing side-channel analysis
# Severity: 5.9 (Medium)
# Status: No upstream fix available as of 2026-02-03
#
# Risk Assessment for lib3mf-rs:
# - ACCEPTABLE: This vulnerability requires:
#   1. Attacker observing thousands of decryption operations
#   2. Precise timing measurements (nanosecond precision)
#   3. Statistical analysis of timing variations
#
# - Typical lib3mf-rs usage (parsing/validating 3MF files) does not expose
#   repeated decryption operations to potential attackers in a way that would
#   make this attack practical.
#
# - The RSA operations are used for:
#   - Digital signature verification (public key operations - not vulnerable)
#   - Encrypted key unwrapping (limited, non-repeated operations)
#
# - Attack requires local or network-adjacent position to measure timing
#
# Mitigation Plan:
# - Monitor for upstream fix in RustCrypto/RSA repository
# - Re-evaluate when rsa crate v0.10+ is released
# - Consider migration to constant-time RSA implementation if available
